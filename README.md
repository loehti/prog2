# What this project does

This project is supposed to help people that look after different kinds of animals either as their owner, a foster or a pet sitter, to save and organize all the information that they need on a daily basis. 
This includes: animal, name, age, medication, special needs and so on. New factors can be added in the code if needed.

# Why this project is useful

This project is useful, because you can organize everything in one program and every information has their place, as opposed to writing everything down in a notes file on your phone
and struggling to find it. 

# How to start

Since the project currently isn't running smoothly, it's not ready to be used.

# What version of Python is needed

I wrote the project on Python 3.7, so I suggest you use this version at least.
